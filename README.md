**15. Verify Appium Android setup using appium-doctor:**

*The following command will check the Android Setup with Appium and provide us with detailed log.*

              appium-doctor --android


__Checks like NodeJS was installed, ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME environment variables are set correctly,
etc are verified and detailed logs are provided.__

__If any configuration is missing it will be provided in the logs and accordingly needs to be
fixed for Appium to be set up correctly.__

*ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME and ADB set is given below:*

__1. Firstly, we can open ~/.bashrc file using given below the command:__

                          gedit ~/.bashrc

__2. after that we can set ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME and ADB in ~/.bashrc file like given below:__

                               export ANDROID_HOME='/home/arcgate/Android/Sdk'

                               export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64"

                               export ADB="/home/arcgate/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb"


__3. ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME and ADB is successfully set we can press save button on ~/.bashrc file after that we can close ~/.bashrc file.__

__4. then we can run on terminal given below the command:__

                               source ~/.bashrc

__5. then we can run given below command for succesfully set on bashrc file__

                              appium-doctor --android


***If all the checks pass and there are no fix required, your Android Appium setup is configured correctly.***

## Required thing only for our project

**24. check python version given below the command:**

             python -V

**25. successfully installed python in our local machine. we can create virtual environment in our project**
